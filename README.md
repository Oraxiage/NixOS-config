# NixOS-config
## Overview
This is my NixOS-Hyprland setup. You're welcome to use, modify, or share it as you see fit.

While I haven't tried deploying it on another system yet, the process should be simple. Just enable the flakes feature and install git, then clone the repository. After that, adjust the username, hostname, and home directory settings to suit your needs.
